# Group 48 Project Proposal
## Introduction/Background
### Literature Review:
Music information retrieval, or MIR, is a growing science where datasets are used to extract musical information from songs or other forms of music. [9] There has been a growing interest in utilizing song lyrics as a valuable source of information for genre classification. Existing studies have explored various methods, such as natural language processing and statistical models, to extract meaningful features from lyrics and predict musical genres accurately [10]. We attempt to harness MIR extraction technology, especially predictive ML modeling, to determine if the lyrics of a song predict its genre. 

### Dataset Description:
The dataset encompasses a wide range of musical genres, offering diversity essential for training a robust model. In the context of predicting music genres from song lyrics, the musiXmatch dataset offers word frequency information in a standardized format, thus allowing for efficient feature extraction, a crucial step in training machine learning models. The bag-of-words representation captures linguistic patterns, which genre-correlated patterns can be discerned from.The inclusion of various genres ensures the model's capability to generalize across different musical styles.

## Problem Definition
### Problem
The objective of our project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the genre of a song from its lyrics. This process involves determining a set of appropriate music genres into which songs can be placed, converting song lyrics into usable data, and the classification of lyrics into distinct musical genres by leveraging patterns and features extracted from the textual content of lyrics.

### Motivation
Our motivation for this project is to help increase the diversity and scope of streaming platforms and other services. Automated genre classification is crucial to the function of platforms and recommendations systems, and by making a model that can potentially place songs into genres without artist or platform manager intervention, the user experience and content organization on streaming platforms may be enhanced. Further, understanding the relationship between lyrics and genres could provide insights into the evolving trends and themes within different music genres as well as insights into cultural traditions.
