## Introduction/Background
### Literature Review:
Music information retrieval, or MIR, is a growing science where datasets are used to extract musical information from songs or other forms of music. [9] There has been a growing interest in utilizing song lyrics as a valuable source of information for genre classification. Existing studies have explored various methods, such as natural language processing and statistical models, to extract meaningful features from lyrics and predict musical genres accurately [10]. We attempt to harness MIR extraction technology, especially predictive ML modeling, to determine if the lyrics of a song predict its genre. 

### Dataset Description:
The dataset encompasses a wide range of musical genres, offering diversity essential for training a robust model. In the context of predicting music genres from song lyrics, the musiXmatch dataset offers word frequency information in a standardized format, thus allowing for efficient feature extraction, a crucial step in training machine learning models. The bag-of-words representation captures linguistic patterns, which genre-correlated patterns can be discerned from.The inclusion of various genres ensures the model's capability to generalize across different musical styles.
